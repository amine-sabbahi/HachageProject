## Introduction
This project aims to implement various hashing and indexing algorithms within a graphical user interface using the Customtkinter library and the Python programming language. These data structures and algorithms are essential in efficient data management and form the backbone of many modern computing applications.

## Requirements and Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- Implement functional hashing algorithms including linear probing, quadratic probing, double hashing, internal chaining, separate chaining, and B+ trees.
- Develop an intuitive and user-friendly interface to interact with these algorithms.
- Ensure effective collision management in each hashing algorithm.
- Optimize the algorithms for performance and resource efficiency.
- Design the application architecture for easy extensibility for future enhancements.

## Proposed Interface
The application interface is designed to be a central dashboard that provides an overview of the application. The interface includes buttons for quick access to different sections of the application, allowing users to explore the functionalities of various hashing algorithms easily. Each algorithm has a dedicated interface for its implementation and functionality.

## Hashing Techniques
### Linear Probing
Linear probing is a collision resolution technique that searches linearly in the hash table to find the next available slot.

#### Linear Probing Example

### Quadratic Probing
Quadratic probing uses a quadratic function to determine the next slots to check for inserting or finding an element, reducing clustering compared to linear probing.

### Double Hashing
Double hashing employs a second hash function to calculate additional probe sequences, providing a better distribution and reducing clustering.

### Internal Chaining
Internal chaining involves using links between records to navigate through data efficiently, using primary and foreign keys to establish relationships.

### Separate Chaining
Separate chaining stores elements with the same hash value in linked lists, efficiently managing collisions by storing elements in separate lists.

### B+ Tree
B+ trees are balanced tree structures used primarily in database systems for efficient data organization and storage.
